Having seen how launch files can be used, we’re ready now to think about how to create
them for ourselves.

### Where to place launch files

As with all other ROS files, each launch file should be associated with a particular package.
The usual naming scheme is to give launch files names ending with `.launch.` The simplest
place to store launch files is directly in the package directory. When looking for launch
files, `roslaunch` will also search subdirectories of each package directory. Some packages,
including many of the core ROS packages, utilize this feature by organizing launch files
into a subdirectory of their own, usually called `launch`.

### Basic ingredients

The simplest launch files consist of a root element containing several `node` elements.

#### Inserting the root element

Launch files are XML documents, and every XML document
must have exactly one **root element**. For ROS launch files, the root element is defined by a
pair of `launch` tags:

```
<launch>
...
</launch>
```

All of the other elements of each launch file should be enclosed between these tags.

#### Launching nodes

The heart of any launch file is a collection of node elements, each of
which names a single [node](http://wiki.ros.org/roslaunch/XML/node) to launch. A node element looks like this:

```
<node
pkg="package-name"
type="executable-name"
name="node-name"
/>
```

>⚠️ The trailing slash near the end of the node tag is both important and easy to forget.
> It indicates that no closing tag (“`</node>`”) is coming, and that the node element
> is complete. XML parsers are required to be very strict about this sort of thing. If
> you omit this slash, be prepared for errors like this:
> 
> ```Invalid roslaunch XML syntax: mismatched tag```
> 
> You can also also write the closing tag explicitly:
> 
>```node pkg="..." type="..." name="..."></node>```
>
> In fact, this explicit closing tag is needed if the node has children, such as `remap` or
> `param` elements. These elements are introduced in Section 6.4 and 7.4, respectively

A `node` element has three required attributes:

- The `pkg` and `type` attributes identify which program ROS should run to start this
node. These are the same as the two command line arguments to `rosrun`, specifying
the package name and the executable name, respectively.
- The `name` attribute assigns a name to the node. This overrides any name that the
node would normally assign to itself in its call to `ros::init`.

> ⏩This override fully clobbers the naming information provided to `ros::init`, 
> including any request that the node might have made for an anonymous name.
> (See Section 5.4.) To use an anonymous name from within a [launch](http://wiki.ros.org/roslaunch/XML) file, use
> an `anon` substitution for the name attribute, like this:
>  
> ```name="$(anon base_name)"```
>  
> Note, however, that multiple uses of the same base name will generate the
> same anonymous name. This means that (a) we can refer to that name in
> other parts of the launch file, but (b) we must be careful to use different base
> names for each node we want to anonymize.
