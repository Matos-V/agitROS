# 6.5 Other launch file elements
This section introduces a few [**additional roslaunch constructions**](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/Roslaunchtipsforlargerprojects). 
To illustrate these
features, we’ll refer to the launch file in Listing 6.6. This launch file starts either two or
three independent `turtlesim` simulators, depending on how it is launched.

### 6.5.1 Including other files
To include the contents of another launch file, including all of its nodes and parameters,
use an [**include element**](http://wiki.ros.org/roslaunch/XML/include):
```
<include file="path-to-launch-file" />
```
The file attribute expects the full path to the file we want to include. Because it can be
both cumbersome and brittle to enter this information directly, most include elements
use a find substitution to search for a package, instead of explicitly naming a directory:

```
<include file="$(find package-name)/launch-file-name" />
```
The find argument is expanded, via a string substitution, to the path to the given package.
The specific launch file is usually much easier to name from there. The example uses this
technique to include our previous example, `doublesim.launch`.
```console
$ example.launch
<launch>
<node
pkg="turtlesim"
type="turtlesim_node"
name="turtlesim"
respawn="true"
/>
<node
pkg="turtlesim"
type="turtle_teleop_key"
name="teleop_key"
required="true"
launch−prefix="xterm −e"
/>
<node
pkg="agitr"
type="subpose "
name="pose_subscriber "
output="screen"
/>
</launch>
```
```
roslaunch package-name launch-file-name
```
You can invoke the example launch file using this command:
```
roslaunch agitr example.launch
```
If everything works correctly, this command will start three nodes. You should get `turtlesim` window, 
along with another window that accepts arrow key presses for teleoperating
the `turtle`. The original terminal in which you ran the `roslaunch` command should show
the pose information logged by our subpose program. Before starting any nodes, `roslaunch` will 
determine whether `roscore` is already running and, if not, start it automatically.

The include element also supports the `ns` attribute for pushing its contents into a
namespace:
```
<include file=". . . " ns="namespace" />
```

</p>

This setup occurs fairly commonly, especially when the included launch file is part of a
another package, and should operate mostly independently of the rest of the nodes.

### 6.5.2 Launch arguments
To help make launch files configurable, `roslaunch` supports **launch arguments**, also called
**arguments** or even **args**, which function somewhat like local variables in an executable
program. The advantage is that you can avoid code duplication by writing launch files
that use arguments for the small number of details that might change from run to run.
To illustrate this idea, the example launch file uses one argument, called `use_sim3`, to
determine whether to start three copies of turtlesim or only two.
