# Parameters in turtlesim

For a more concrete example of how parameters can be useful, let’s see how turtlesim uses
them. If you start roscore and a `turtlesim_node`, and then ask for a rosparam list, you’ll
see output like this:

```
/background_b
/background_g
/background_r
/rosdistro
/roslaunch/uris/host_donatello__59636
/rosversion
/run_id
```

We’ve already seen those last four parameters, which are created by the master. In addition,
it looks like our `turtlesim_node` has created three parameters. Their names (correctly)
suggest that they specify the background color that `turtlesim` is using, separated into red,
green, and blue channels.

This illustrates that nodes can, and sometimes do, create and modify parameter values.
In this case, `turtlesim_node` sets those three parameters as part of its initialization. In this
regard, `turtlesim_node` is atypical, because its initialization will clobber any values that
might already have been set for those parameters. That is, every `turtlesim_node` starts
with the same blue background, at least for a short time, regardless of any steps we might
take to specify a different starting color.

### Reading the background color

We can inspect the values of the background parameters using rosparam get:

```
/rosparam get /background_r
/rosparam get /background_g
/rosparam get /background_b
```

The values returned by these commands are 69, 86, and 255. Since the values are relatively
small integers, a good guess (and, it turns out, a correct guess) is that each channel is an
8-bit integer, ranging from 0 to 255. Thus, `turtlesim` defaults to a background color of
(69, 86, 255), corresponding to the deep blue color to which we’re accustomed.

### Setting the background color

Suppose we want to change the background from this
blue color to a bright yellow instead. We might try to do this by changing the parameter
values after the `turtlesim` node starts up:

```
/rosparam set /background_r 255
/rosparam set /background_g 255
/rosparam set /background_b 0
```

However, even after setting these parameters, the background color remains the same.
Why? The explanation is that `turtlesim_node` only reads the values of these parameters
when its `/clear` service is called. One way to call this service is using this command:

```
/rosservice call /clear
```

After the service call completes, the background color will finally be changed appropriately. 
Figure 7.1 shows the effect of this change. The important thing to notice here is that updated
parameter values are not automatically “pushed” to nodes. Instead, nodes that care about changes 
to some or all of their parameters must explicitly ask the parameter server for those values. 
Likewise, if we expect to change the values of parameters used by an active node, we must be aware of how
(or if ) that node re-queries its parameters. (Quite often, but not for turtlesim, the answer
is based on a subsystem called [`dynamic_reconfigure`](http://wiki.ros.org/dynamic_reconfigure), which we do not cover here.
