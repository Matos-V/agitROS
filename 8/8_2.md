# Finding and calling services from the command line

Although services are most commonly used by code within nodes, there do exist a few command line tools for interacting with them. Experimenting with these tools can make it easier to understand how service calls work.

### Listing all services

You can get a list of services that are currently active using this [command](http://wiki.ros.org/rosservice):

`rosservice list`

On the author’s computer, with just a turtlesim node running, the list of services looks like this:

```
/clear
/kill
/reset
/rosout/get_loggers
/rosout/set_logger_level
/spawn
/turtle1/set_pen
/turtle1/teleport_absolute
/turtle1/teleport_relative
/turtlesim/get_loggers
/turtlesim/set_logger_level
```

Each line shows the name of one service that is currently available to call. Service names are graph resource names, and like other graph resource names can be specified as global, relative, or private names. The output of `rosservice` list shows the full global name of each service.

The services in this example, and many ROS services in general, can be divided into two basic types.

- Some services, such as the get_loggers and `set_logger_level` services in the list above, are used to get information from or pass information to specific nodes. These kinds of services usually use their node’s name as a namespace to prevent name collisions, and to allow their nodes to offer them via private names like `∼get_loggers` or `∼set_logger_level`. (See Section 4.5 for details about loggers and logger levels.)

- Other services represent more general capabilities that are not conceptually tied to any particular node. For example, the service called `/spawn`, which creates a new simulated turtle, is offered by the turtlesim node. However, in a different system, this service could conceivably be offered by a different node; when we call `/spawn`, we only care that a new turtle is created, not about the details of which node does that work. All of the services in the list above, except the `get_loggers` and `set- _logger_level` services, fit this description. These kinds of services typically have names that describe their function, but that do not mention any specific node.

### Listing services by node

To see the services offered by one particular node, use the rosnode info command:

` rosnode info node-name`

For example, here’s the relevant portion of the output of this command for a `turtlesim` node:

```
Services:
* /turtle1/teleport_absolute
* /turtlesim/get_loggers
* /turtlesim/set_logger_level
* /reset
* /spawn
* /clear
* /turtle1/set_pen
* /turtle1/teleport_relative
* /kill
```

This shows, hopefully unsurprisingly, that most of the services currently available are offered by the turtlesim node. (The only exceptions are the two logging services offered by `/rosout`.)

### Finding the node offering a service

To perform the reverse query—that is, to see which node offers a given service—use this command:

`rosservice node service-name`

As expected, this command outputs `/turtlesim` when asked about any of the services listed by `rosnode` info `/turtlesim`, and `/rosout` when asked about the other two services.

### Finding the data type of a service

You can determine the service data type of a service using a command like this:

`rosservice info service-name`

For example, from the command

`rosservice info /spawn`

the output is:

```
Node: /turtlesim
URI: rosrpc://donatello:47441
Type: turtlesim/Spawn
Args: x y theta name
```

We can see that the data type of the `/spawn` service is `turtlesim/Spawn`. As with message types, a service data type has two parts, one naming the package that owns the type, and one naming the type itself:

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77112891/126490664-9c71000c-d291-4dbd-b285-6f9c353c616a.png" width="400"/><br>
</p>

Service data types are always referenced by these kinds of complete names.

### Inspecting service data types

We can get some details about service data types using the rossrv command:

`rossrv show service-data-type-name`

For example,

`rossrv show turtlesim/Spawn`

produces this output:

```
float32 x
float32 y
float32 theta
string name
---
string name
```

In this case, the data before the dashes (---) are the elements of the **request**. This is the information that the client node sends to the server node. Everything after the dashes is the **response**, or information that the server sends back from the client when the server has finished acting on the request.

> *Be careful about the difference between `rosservice` and `rossrv`. The former is for interacting with services that are currently offered by some node. The latter—whose name comes from the `.srv` extension used for files that declare service data types— is for asking about service data types, whether or not any currently available service has that type. The difference is similar to the difference between the `rostopic` and rosmsg commands:*
>
> |                  | **Topics** | **Services** |
> | ---------------- | ---------- | ------------ |
> |**active things** | `rostopic` | `rosservice` | 
> | **data types**   | `rosmsg`   |   `rossrv`   | 

Note that the request, the response, or both can be empty. For example, in the /reset service offered by `turtlesim_node`, which has type `std_srvs/Empty`, both the request and response parts are empty. This is roughly equivalent to a C++ function that accepts no arguments and returns void. No information goes in or out, but useful things (that is, side effects) still may happen.

### Calling services from the command line

To get a feel for how services work, you can call them from the command line using this command:

`rosservice call service-name request-content`

The request content part should list values for each field of the request, as shown by rossrv show. Here’s an example:

`rosservice call /spawn 3 3 0 Mikey`

The effect of this service call is to create a new turtle named “Mikey,” at position (x, y) = (3, 3), facing angle θ = 0, within the existing simulator.

> This new turtle comes with its own set of resources, including `cmd_vel`, pose, and `color_sensor` topics and `set_pen`, `teleport_absolute`, `teleport_relative` services. These new resources live in a namespace called—in this example—`Mikey`. These are in addition to the usual resources in the turtle1 namespace, and are needed to allow other nodes to control the separate turtles individually. This nicely illustrates the way that namespaces can prevent name collisions.

The output from `rosservice` call shows the server’s response data. For the example above, the response should be:

`name: Mikey`

In this case, the server sends the new turtle’s name back as part of the response. 

In addition to sending the response data, the server also tells the client whether the call has succeed or failed. For example, in `turtlesim`, each turtle must have a unique name. If we run the `rosservice` call example above twice, the first call should succeed, but the second will generate an error that looks like this:

`ERROR: service [/spawn] responded with an error:`

The error occurs because we’ve attempted to create two turtles with the same name.

> This error message ends with a colon because `turtlesim` has replied with an empty error message. The underlying infrastructure is able to return short error message strings when service calls fail, but the C++ client library, which `turtlesim` is using, does not provide an easy way to return a non-empty error message.
