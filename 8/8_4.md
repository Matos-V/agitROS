Now let's take a look at the other side of service calls, by writing a program that acts as a
server. A [Lista 8.2](#lista-82) shows an example that offers a service called `toggle_forward` and also
drives a `turtlesim` robot, alternating between forward motions and rotations each time
that service is called.

#### **Lista 8.2**
{: .no_toc }
##### A program called  `pubvel_toggle.cpp` that changes the velocity commands it publishes, based on a service that it offers.
{: .no_toc }
```
// This program toggles between rotation and translation
// commands, based on calls to a service.
#include <ros/ros.h>
#include <std_srvs/Empty.h>
#include <geometry_msgs/Twist.h>

bool forward = true;
bool toggleForward(
  std_srvs : : Empty : : Request &req ,
  std_srvs : : Empty : : Response &resp
) {
  forward = ! forward ;
  ROS_INFO_STREAM("Now␣sending␣" << ( forward ?
  "forward" : " rotate ") << "␣commands . ") ;
  return true ;
}

int main( int argc , char ∗∗ argv ) {
  ros::init( argc , argv , "pubvel_toggle") ;
  ros::NodeHandle nh ;

  // Register our service with the master.
  ros::ServiceServer server = nh.advertiseService (
  "toggle_forward" , &toggleForward) ;

  // Publish commands, using the latest value for forward,
  // until the node shuts down.
  ros::Publisher pub = nh.advertise <geometry_msgs::Twist>(
  "turtle1/cmd_vel" , 1000);
  ros::Rate rate(2);
  while ( ros::ok() ) {
  geometry_msgs::Twist msg ;
  msg.linear.x = forward ? 1.0:0.0 ;
  msg.angular.z = forward ? 0.0:1.0 ;
  pub.publish(msg) ;
  ros : : spinOnce () ;
  rate . sleep () ;
  }
}
```

The code for acting as a server is remarkably similar to the code for subscribing to a
topic. Aside from differences in names — we must create a `ros::ServiceServer` instead of a
`ros::Subscriber` — the only difference is that a server can send data back to the client, via
both a response object and a boolean indication of success or failure.

## Writing a service callback 
Just like with subscriptions, each service that our nodes offer
must be associated with a callback function. A service callback looks like this:

```
bool function_name(
  package_name::service_type::Request &req,
  package_name::service_type::Response &resp
) {
  ...
}
```

ROS executes the callback function once for each service call that our node receives. The
Request parameter contains the data sent from the client. The callback's job is to fill in
the data members of the `Response` object. These are the same `Request` and `Response`
types that we used on the client side above, and as such, they require the same header and
the same package dependencies to compile properly. The callback function should return
true to indicate success or false to indicate failure.

In the example, we use the `std_srvs/Empty` message type, in which both the `Request`
and `Response` sides are empty, so there is no processing to perform for either of those
objects. The callback's only work is to toggle a global boolean variable, called `forward`,
that governs the velocity messages published in `main`.

## Creating a server object
 To associate the callback function with a service name, and to
offer the service to other nodes, we must `advertise` the service:

```
ros::ServiceServer server = node_handle.advertiseService(
  service_name,
  pointer_to_callback_function
);
```

All of these elements have appeared before.

- The `node_handle` is the same old node handle that we know and love.
- The `service_name` is a the string name of the service we would like to offer. This
should be a relative name, but could also be a global name.

> ⏩ Because of some perceived ambiguity in how private names should be resolved,
`ros::NodeHandle::advertiseService` refuses to accept private names
(that is, those that begin with ∼). The solution to this constraint is to exploit
the fact — one we have not used so far — that we can create `ros::NodeHandle`
objects with their own specific default namespaces. For example, we could
create a `ros::NodeHandle` like this:
```
ros::NodeHandle nhPrivate("∼");
```
> The default namespace for any relative names we send to this `NodeHandle`
would then be the same as the node's name. In particular, this means that if
we use this handle and a relative name to advertise a service, it would have the
same effect as using a private name. For example, in a node `named /foo/bar`,
we can advertise a service called `/foo/bar/baz` like this:
```
ros::ServiceServer server = nhPrivate.advertiseService( "baz", callback );
```
> That is, this code has the same effect we might expect from attempting to
advertise a service called `∼baz` using our usual `NodeHandle`, if that handle
were willing to accept private names.
{: .fs-3 .code-example }

- The last parameter is a pointer to the callback function. A quick introduction to
function pointers, including some advice on potential syntax errors, appeared on
page 58. The same ideas apply here.

As with `ros::Subscriber` objects, it is rare to call any methods of `ros::ServiceServer` objects.
Instead, we should keep careful track of the lifetime of that object, because the service will
be available to other nodes only until the `ros::ServiceServer` is destroyed.

## Giving ROS control
 Don't forget that ROS will not execute any callback functions until we
specifically ask it to, using `ros::spin()` or `ros::spinOnce()`. (Details about the differences
between these two functions appear, in the context of a subscriber program, near the end
of Section 3.4.)

In the example, we use `ros::spinOnce()`, instead of `ros::spin()`, because we have other
work to do — specifically, publishing velocity commands — when there are no incoming service calls to process.

## Running and improving the server program

To test the `pubvel_toggle` example program, compile it and run both `turtlesim_node`
and `pubvel_toggle`. With both running, you can switch the motion commands from
translation to rotation and back by calling the `toggle_forward` service from the command
line:
```
rosservice call /toggle_forward
```
[Figure 8.1](#8.1) shows an example of the results.

One potentially unexpected "feature" of this program is that there can be a noticeable
lag between starting the rosservice call command and observing an actual change in the
turtle's motion. A very small part of this delay can be attributed to time needed for communication
between `rosservice` call, `pubvel_toggle`, and `turtlesim_node`. However, most
of the delay comes from the architecture of `pubvel_toggle`. Can you see where?

The answer is that, because we use the sleep method of a a `ros::Rate` object with a
relatively slow frequency (only 2Hz), *this program spends most of its time asleep*. Most
service calls will arrive when the `sleep` is executing, and these service calls cannot execute
until the call to `ros::spinOnce()`, which happens only every 0.5 seconds. Therefore, there
can be a delay of up to about half a second before each service call can be handled.

There are at least two ways to work around this kind of problem:

- We can use two separate threads: one to publish messages, and one to handle service
callbacks. Although ROS doesn't require programs to use threads explicitly, it is quite
cooperative if they do.

- We can replace the `sleep/ros::spinOnce` loop with a `ros::spin`, and use a [**timer callback**](http://wiki.ros.org/roscpp/Overview/Timers)
to the publish messages.

Issues like this can seem minor at this scale — a small delay in changing the turtle's
movement pattern may not be a major problem — but for programs for which the timing is more
important, the difference can be crucial.
