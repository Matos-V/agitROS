Here is the basic flow of information for service calls:

The idea is that a **client** node sends some data called a **request** to a **server** node and waits for a reply. The server, having received this request, takes some action (computing something, configuring hardware or software, changing its own behavior, etc.) and sends some data called a **response** back to the client.

The specific content of the request and response data is determined by the **service data type**, which is analogous to the message types that determine the content of messages (recall Section 2.7.2). Like a message type, a service data type is defined by a collection of named fields. The only difference is that a service data type is divided into two parts, representing the request (which is supplied by the client to the server) and the response (which is sent by the server back to the client).
