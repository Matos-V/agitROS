Calling services from the command line is handy for exploring and for things that only
need to be done occasionally, but of course it's much more useful to be able to call services
from your [code](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/WritingServiceClient(c++)).
A [Lista 8.1](#lista-81) shows a short example of how to do that. That example
illustrates all of the basic elements of a service client program.

#### **Lista 8.1**
{: .no_toc }
##### A program called `spawn_turtle.cpp` that calls a service.
{: .no_toc }
```
// This program spawns a new turtlesim turtle by calling
// the appropriate service.
#include <ros/ros.h>

// The srv class for the service.
#include <turtlesim/Spawn.h>

int main(int argc, char ∗∗argv){
ros::init(argc, argv, "spawn_turtle");
ros::NodeHandle nh;

// Create a client object for the spawn service. This
// needs to know the data type of the service and its
// name.
ros::ServiceClient spawnClient
   = nh.serviceClient <turtlesim::Spawn>("spawn");

// Create the request and response objects.
turtlesim::Spawn::Request req;
turtlesim::Spawn::Response resp;

// Fill in the request data members.
req.x = 2;
req.y = 3;
req.theta = M_PI/2;
req.name = "Leo";

// Actually call the service. This won't return until
// the service is complete .
bool success = spawnClient.call(req, resp);

// Check for success and use the response.
if(success){
ROS_INFO_STREAM("Spawned a turtle named "
  << resp.name);
}else{
ROS_ERROR_STREAM("Failed to spawn.");
}

}
```

## Declaring the request and response types
 Just like message types (recall Section 3.3.1),
every service data has an associated C++ header file that we must include:

```
#include <package_name/type_name.h>
```

In the example, we say

```
#include <turtlesim/Spawn.h>
```

to include the definition of a class called `turtlesim::Spawn`, which defines the data type —
including both the request and response parts — of the service we want to call.

## Creating a client object
 After initializing itself as a node (by calling `ros::init` and creating a `NodeHandle` object),
our program must create an object of type `ros::ServiceClient`,
whose job is to actually carry out the service call. The declaration of a `ros::ServiceClient`
looks like this:

```
ros::ServiceClient client = node_handle.serviceClient<service_type>(service_name);
```

This line has three important parts.

- The `node_handle` is the usual `ros::NodeHandle` object. We're calling its `serviceClient` method.
- The `service_type` is the name of the service object defined in the header file we
included above. In the example, it's `turtlesim::Spawn`.
- The `service_name` is a string naming the service that we want to call. This should
be a relative name, but can also be a global name. The example uses the relative
name "spawn".

By default, creating this object is relatively inexpensive because it doesn't do much, except
to store the details about the service we'll want to call later.

> ⚠️ Notice that creating a to the analogous `ros::Publisher` does not require a queue size, in contrast
to the analogous `ros::ServiceClient`. This difference occurs because service calls do not return until the response arrives.
Because the client waits for the service call to complete, there is no need to maintain a queue of outgoing service calls.
{: .fs-3 .code-example }

## Creating request and response objects
 Once the `ros::ServiceClient` has been constructed,
the next step is to create a request object to contain the data to be sent to the server.
The header we included above includes separate classes for the response and request parts
of the service data type, named `Request` and `Response`, respectively. These classes must
be referenced via the package name and service type, like this:

```
package_name::service_type::Request
package_name::service_type::Response
```

Each of these classes has data members matching the fields of the service type. (Recall that
`rossrv` show can list those fields and their data types for us.) These fields are mapped to
C++ data types in the same way that messages fields are. The `Request` constructor supplies
meaningless default values for those fields, so we should assign a value to each field. In
the example, we create a `turtlesim::Spawn::Request` object and assign values to its `x`, `y`,
`theta`, and `name` fields.

We'll also need a `Response` object — in the example, a `turtlesim::Spawn::Response`—
but, since that information should come from the server, we should not attempt to fill in
its data members.

> ⚠️ Service type header files also define a single class (a struct really) named
```
package_name::service_type
```
> that contains both a `Request` and a `Response` as data members. An object from this
class is usually called a `srv`. If you prefer — as the authors of many online tutorials
apparently do — you can pass an object of this class to the `call` method introduced
below, instead of separate `Request` and `Response` objects.
{: .fs-3 .code-example }

## Calling the service
 Once we have a `ServiceClient`, a completed `Request`, and a `Response`,
we can actually call the service:

```
bool success = service_client.call(request, response)
```

This method does the actual work of locating the server node, transmitting the request
data, waiting for a response, and storing the response data the `Response` we provided.


The call method returns a boolean value that tells us if the service call completed successfully. Failures
can occur because of problems with the ROS infrastructure — for example, attempting to call a service
not offered by any node — or for reasons specific to an individual service. In the example, a failed
call most commonly indicates that another turtle already exists with the requested name.

> ⚠️ A common mistake is to fail to check the return value of `call`. This can lead to unexpected problems
if the service `call` fails. It takes only a minute or two to add code to
check this value and call `ROS_ERROR_STREAM` when the service call fails. It's
quite likely that this investment of time will be repaid with easier debugging in the
future.
{: .fs-3 .code-example }

> ⏩ By default, the process of finding and connecting to the server node occurs inside
the `call` method. This connection is used for that service call and then closed before
`call` returns. ROS also supports a concept of persistent service clients, in which the
`ros::ServiceClient` constructor establishes a connection to the server, which is then
reused for every subsequent call for that client object. A persistent service client can
be created by passing `true` for the second parameter of the constructor (which we've
allowed to default to false in the previous examples)
```
ros::ServiceClient client = node_handle.advertise<service_type>(
service_name, true);
```
> The use of persistent clients is mildly discouraged by the
[documentation](https://docs.ros.org/en/api/roscpp/html/classros_1_1NodeHandle.html),
because the performance gains tend to be rather small — The author's informal experiments showed an
improvement of only about 10% — and the resulting system can
be less robust to restarts or changes of the server node.
{: .fs-3 .code-example }

After the service call successfully completes, you access the response data from the
`Request` object that you passed to `call`. In the example, the response includes only an
echo of the `name` field from the request.

## Declaring a dependency
 That's all there is to the client code. However, to get `catkin_make`
to correctly compile a client program, we must be sure that the program's package
declares a dependency on the package that owns the service type. Such dependencies,
which are the same as those we needed for message types (recall Section 3.3.3), require
edits to `CMakeLists.txt` and to the manifest, `package.xml`. To compile the example
program, we must ensure that the `find_package` line in `CMakeLists.txt` mentions the `turtlesim` package:

```
find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS roscpp turtlesim)
```
In `package.xml`, we should ensure that `build_depend` and `run_depend` elements exist
that name the package:

```
<build_depend>turtlesim</build_depend>
<run_depend>turtlesim</run_depend>
```

After completing these changes, the usual `catkin_make` should compile the program.
