# Enabling and disabling log messages

If you executed the programs in Listings 4.1, 4.4, and 4.5 for yourself (or read the sample output in Listing 4.2 carefully), 
you might have noticed that no `DEBUG`-level messages are generated, even though those programs call the `ROS_DEBUG_STREAM` macro. 
What happened to those `DEBUG`-level messages? The answer is that, by default, ROS C++ programs only generate log messages at the INFO level and higher; 
attempts to generate `DEBUG`-level messages are discarded.

This is a specific example of the concept of **logger levels**, which specify, for each node, a minimum severity level. The default logger level is `INFO`, 
which explains the absence of `DEBUG`-level messages from our example program. The general idea behind logger levels is to provide, at run time, 
the ability to regulate the level of detail for each node’s logs.

> ⚠️ Setting the logger level is somewhat similar to the severity filtering options in `rqt_console`. The difference is that changing the logger
> level prevents log messages from ever being generated at their source, whereas the filters in `rqt_console` accept any incoming log messages,
> and selectively choose not to display some of them. Except for some overhead, the effect is similar.

There are several ways to set a node's logger level.

**Setting the logger level from the command line**  - To set a node's logger level from the command line, use a command like this:

<pre>
<code>
rosservice call /<em>node-name</em>/set_logger_level ros.<em>package-name level</em>
</code>
</pre>

This command calls a service called `set_logger_level`, which is provided automatically
by each node. (We’ll study services more carefully in Chapter 8.)

- The _node-name_ is the name of the node whose logger level you would like to set.
- The _package-name_ is, as you might expect, the name of the package that owns the
node.
- The _level_ parameter is a string, chosen from DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR,
and FATAL, naming the logger level to use for that node.

For example, to enable `DEBUG`-level messages in our example program, we could use
this command:

```
rosservice call /count_and_log/set_logger_level ros.agitr DEBUG
```

Note that, because this command communicates directly with the node in question, we
cannot use it until after the node is started. If everything works correctly, this call to `rosservice` will output nothing but a blank line.

**Setting the logger level from a GUI** - If you prefer a GUI instead of this command line
interface, try this command:

```
rqt_logger_level
```

The resulting window, shown in [Figure 4.3](#4.3), allows you to select from a list of nodes, a list of
loggers—You almost certainly want `ros`.*package-name*—and finally a list of logger levels.
Changing the logger level using this tool has the same effect as the rosservice command
mentioned above, because it uses the same service call interface to each node.

**Setting the logger level from C++ code** - It is also possible for a node to modify its own
logger levels. The most direct way to do this is to access the `log4cxx` infrastructure that
ROS uses to implement its logging features, using code like this:

```
#include <log4cxx/logger.h>
  . . .
log4cxx::Logger::getLogger(ROSCONSOLE_DEFAULT_NAME)->setLevel(
  ros::console::g_level_lookup[ros::console::levels::Debug]
);
ros::console::notifyLoggerLevelsChanged();
```

Aside from the necessary syntactic camouflage, this code should be readily identifiable as
setting the logger level to `DEBUG`. The `Debug` token can, of course, be replaced by `Info`,
`Warn`, `Error`, or `Fatal`.

> ⏩ The call to `ros::console::notifyLoggerLevelsChanged()` is necessary because the
> enabled/disabled status of each logging statement is cached. It can be omitted if
> you set the logger level before any logging statements are executed.
