So far, we've said quite a bit about how to create log messages, but very little 
about wherethose messages actually go. There are actually three different destinations 
for log messages: Each log message can appear as output on the console, as a message on 
the rosout topic, and as an entry in a log file. Let's see how to use each of these.

## Console

First, and most visibly, log messages are sent to the console. Specifically, `DEBUG` and
`INFO` messages are printed on standard output, whereas `WARN`, `ERROR`, and `FATAL` messages 
are sent to standard [error](http://wiki.ros.org/roscpp/Overview/Logging).

> ⏩ The distinction here between standard output and standard error is basically irrelevant, 
> unless you want to redirect one or both of these streams to a file or a pipe, in
> which case it causes some complications. The usual file redirection technique
> ```
> command > file
> ```
> redirects standard output, but not standard error. To capture all of the log messages
> to the same file, use something like this instead:
> ```
> command &> file
> ```
> Be careful, however, because differences in the way these two streams are buffered
> can cause the messages to appear out of order — with `DEBUG` and `INFO` messages
> appearing later than one might expect — in the result. You can force the messages
> into their natural order by using the stdbuf command to convince standard output
> to use line buffering:
> ```
> stdbuf -oL command &> file
> ```
> Finally, note that ROS inserts ANSI color codes — which look, to humans and to software that 
> does not understand them, something like this: `ˆ[[0m` — into its output,/even if the output 
> is not being directed to a terminal. To view a file containing thesesorts of codes, try a 
> command like this:
> ```
> less -r file
> ```

### Formatting console messages

You can tweak the format used to print log messages on
the console by setting the `ROSCONSOLE_FORMAT` environment variable. This variable will 
generally contain one or more field names, each denoted by a dollar sign and curly braces, 
showing where the log message data should be inserted. The default format is equivalent to:
```
[${severity}] [${time}]: ${message}
```
This format is probably suitable for most uses, but there are a few other fields that might
be useful:

- To insert details about the source code location from which the message was generated, use some combination of the `${file}`, `${line}`, and `${function}` fields.
- To insert the name of the node that generated the log message, use the `${node}` field

> ⚠️ The `roslaunch` tool (which we'll introduce in Chapter 6) does not, by default, funnel
> standard output and standard error from the nodes it launches to its own output
> streams. To see output from a roslaunched node, you must explicitly use the `output="screen"`
>  attribute, or force all nodes to have this attribute with the `--screen`
> command-line parameter to roslaunch.

## Messages on `rosout`

In addition to appearing on the console, every log message is also published on the topic
`/rosout`. The message type of this topic is `rosgraph_msgs/Log`. [Lista 4.6](#lista-46) shows the
fields in this data type, which includes the severity level, the message itself, and some other
associated metadata.

#### **Lista 4.6**

```

You might notice that the information in each of these messages is quite similar to
the details in the console output discussed above. The primary usefulness of the `/rosout`
topic, compared to the console output, is that it includes, in a single stream, log messages
from every node in the system. All of those log messages show up on `/rosout`, regardless
of where, when, or how their nodes were started, or even which computer they're running
on.

Since `/rosout` is just an ordinary topic, you could, of course, use
```
rostopic echo /rosout
```
to see the messages directly. If you insist, could even write a program of your own 
to subscribe to /rosout and display or process the messages however you like. 
However, the [simplest way](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/UsingRqtconsoleRoslaunch) to see /rosout messages is to use [this command](http://wiki.ros.org/rqt_console):
```
rqt_console
```

[Figure 4.2](4.2) depicts the resulting GUI. It shows log messages from all nodes, one per line,
along with options to hide or highlight messages based on various kinds of filters. The GUI
itself should not need any extra explanation.

## Log files
The third and final destination for log messages is a log file generated by the rosout node.
As part of its callback function for the `/rosout` topic, this node writes a line to a file with a
name like this:
```
∼/.ros/log/run_id/rosout.log
```
This `rosout.log` log file is a plain text file. It can be viewed with command line tools like
less, head, or tail, or with your favorite text editor. The `run_id` is a universally-unique
identifier (UUID) which is generated — based on your computer's hardware MAC address
and the current time — when the master is started. Here's an example `run_id`:

```
57aa1860-d765-11e2-a830-f0def1e189cc
```

The use of this sort of unique identifier makes it possible to distinguish logs from separate
ROS sessions.

### Finding the run id 

There at least two easy ways to learn the `run_id` of the current session.
- You can examine the output generated by roscore. Near the end of this output, you'll
see a line that looks something like this.
```
setting /run_id to run_id>
```
- You can ask the master for the current `run_id`, using a command like this:
```
rosparam get /run_id
```

This works because the `run_id` is stored on the parameter server. More details about
parameters are in Chapter 7.

### Checkin and purging log files 
These log files accumulate over time, which can be 
problematic if you use ROS for a while on a system that has meaningful limitations (due either
to an account quota or to hardware limits) on disk space. Both roscore and roslaunch 
perform checks to monitor the size of existing logs, and warn you when they exceed 1GB, but
neither will take any steps to reduce the size. You can use this command to see the amount
of disk space in the current user account consumed by [ROS logs](http://wiki.ros.org/rosclean):
```
rosclean check
```

If the logs are consuming too much disk space, you can remove all of the existing logs using
this command:
```
rosclean purge
```    
You can also, if you prefer, delete the log files by hand.
