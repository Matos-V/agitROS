### Generating simple log messages

There are five basic C++ macros for generating log messages, one for each severity level:

#### **Lista 4.1**
{: .no_toc }
##### A program called `count.cpp` that generates log messages at all five severity levels.
{: .no_toc }
```
  // This program periodically generates log messages at
  // various severity levels.
  #include <ros/ros.h>
 
  int main (int argc, char ∗∗argv) {
    // Initialize the ROS system and become a node.
    ros::init(argc, argv, "count_and_log");
    ros::NodeHandle nh;
 
    // Generate log messages of varying severity regularly.
    ros::Rate rate(10);
    for(int i = 1;ros::ok();i++) {
      ROS_DEBUG_STREAM("Counted␣to␣" << i);
      if((i % 3) == 0) {
        ROS_INFO_STREAM(i << "␣is␣divisible␣by␣3.");
      }
      if((i % 5) == 0) {
        ROS_WARN_STREAM(i << "␣is␣divisible␣by␣5.");
      }
      if((i % 10) == 0) {
        ROS_ERROR_STREAM(i << "␣is␣divisible␣by␣10.");
      }
      if((i % 20) == 0) {
        ROS_FATAL_STREAM(i << "␣is␣divisible␣by␣20.");
      }
      rate.sleep();
   }
 }
```

    ROS_DEBUG_STREAM(message);
    ROS_INFO_STREAM(message);
    ROS_WARN_STREAM(message);
    ROS_ERROR_STREAM(message);
    ROS_FATAL_STREAM(message);
    
The *message* argument of each of these macros can handle exactly the kinds of expressions that work with a C++ ostream, such as `std::cout`. This includes using the insertion
operator (<<) on primitive data types like int or double, on composite types for which that operator is properly overloaded, and on standard stream manipulators like `std::fixed`,
`std::setprecision`, or `std::boolalpha`.

#### **Lista 4.2**
{: .no_toc }
##### Sample output from running count for a few seconds. This output does not contain any `DEBUG`-level messages, because the default minimum level is `INFO`.
{: .no_toc }
```

{: .fs-3 .code-example }

Notice that there's no need to use std::endl nor any other line terminator, because the
logging system is already line-oriented. Each call to any of these macros will generate a
single, complete log message which will be displayed as a single line.

### Generating one-time log messages

Sometimes, log messages that are generated inside
loops or in frequently-called functions are important to the user, but also irritatingly repetitive. 
One natural way to deal with these situations would be to use a static variable to
ensure that the message is generated only once, the first time it is reached. [Lista 4.3](#lista-43)
shows a C++ fragment that would accomplish this. To avoid repeating this cumbersome
block of code — wrapping it in a function would not work, because this technique needs a
distinct static variable for each statement — ROS provides shorthand macros that generate
precisely these sorts of one-time only log messages.
```
ROS_DEBUG_STREAM_ONCE(message);
ROS_INFO_STREAM_ONCE(message);
ROS_WARN_STREAM_ONCE(message);
ROS_ERROR_STREAM_ONCE(message);
ROS_FATAL_STREAM_ONCE(message);
```

The first time these macros are encountered during a program's execution, they generate
the same log messages as the corresponding non-ONCE versions. After that first execution, these statements have no effect. [Lista 4.4](#lista-44) shows a minimal example, in which the
logging macros each generate one message, on the first iteration of the loop, and are ignored on all future iterations.

### Generating throttled log messages

Similarly, there are macros for throttling the rate at
which a given log message appears.

#### **Lista 4.3**
{: .no_toc }
##### A fragment of C++ that disables a log message after its first execution. The `ROS_... _STREAM_ONCE` macros expand to very similar code blocks.
{: .no_toc }

```
// Don't do this directly. Use ROS_..._STREAM_ONCE instead.
{
  static bool first_time = true;
  if(first_time) {
    ROS_INFO_STREAM("Here's␣some␣important␣information"
      << "␣that␣will␣only␣appear␣once.");
    first_time = false;
  }
}
```
 
#### **Lista 4.4**
{: .no_toc }
##### A C++ program called `once.cpp` that generates only five log messages.
{: .no_toc }
```
// This program generates a single log message at each
// severity level.
#include <ros/ros.h>

int main(int argc, char∗∗argv) {
  ros::init(argc, argv, "log_once");
  ros::NodeHandle nh;

  while(ros::ok()) {
   ROS_DEBUG_STREAM_ONCE("This␣appears␣only␣once.");
   ROS_INFO_STREAM_ONCE("This␣appears␣only␣once.");
   ROS_WARN_STREAM_ONCE("This␣appears␣only␣once.");
   ROS_ERROR_STREAM_ONCE("This␣appears␣only␣once.");
   ROS_FATAL_STREAM_ONCE("This␣appears␣only␣once.");
  }
}
```

```
ROS_DEBUG_STREAM_THROTTLE(interval, message);
ROS_INFO_STREAM_THROTTLE(interval, message);
ROS_WARN_STREAM_THROTTLE(interval, message);
ROS_ERROR_STREAM_THROTTLE(interval, message);
ROS_FATAL_STREAM_THROTTLE(interval, message);
```
The *interval* parameter is a double that specifies the minimum amount of time, measured in seconds, that must pass between successive instances of the given log message.

#### **Lista 4.5**
{: .no_toc }
##### A C++ program called `throttle.cpp` that shows throttled log messages.
{: .no_toc }
```
// This program generates log messages at varying severity
// levels, throttled to various maximum speeds.
#include <ros/ros.h>

int main(int argc, char∗∗argv) {
   ros::init(argc, argv, "log_throttled");
   ros::NodeHandle nh;

   while(ros::ok()) {
    ROS_DEBUG_STREAM_THROTTLE(0.1,
      "This␣appears␣every␣0.1␣seconds.");
    ROS_INFO_STREAM_THROTTLE(0.3,
      "This␣appears␣every␣0.3␣seconds.");
    ROS_WARN_STREAM_THROTTLE(0.5,
      "This␣appears␣every␣0.5␣seconds.");
    ROS_ERROR_STREAM_THROTTLE(1.0,
      "This␣appears␣every␣1.0␣seconds.");
    ROS_FATAL_STREAM_THROTTLE(2.0,
      "This␣appears␣every␣2.0␣seconds.");
   }
}
```

Each instance of any `ROS_. . . _STREAM_THROTTLE` macro will generate its log
message the first time it is executed. Subsequent executions will be ignored, until the
specified amount of time has passed. The timeouts are tracked separately (using a local
static variable that stores the "last hit" time) for each instance of any of these macros.
[Lista 4.5](#lista-45) shows a program that uses these macros to get behavior very similar to the
count program from [Lista 4.1](#lista-41). The key difference, apart from the the content of the messages, 
is that the program in [Lista 4.5](#lista-45) will consume more computation time, because it
uses polling, rather than timed sleeping, to decide when it's time to generate new messages. 
This sort of polling is, in real programs, generally a bad idea.
