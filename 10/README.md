# Conclusion

*In which we preview some additional topics*

In the preceding chapters, we’ve looked into the basic workings of ROS in some detail. We
saw examples of most of those concepts using the `turtlesim`  simulator. Of course, it is
quite unlikely that your original interest in ROS was based on a desire to drive imaginary
turtles around. If this book has done its job, you should be ready to start using ROS—
certainly with the help of the documentation, and quite likely with the help of existing
packages—to solve the real robotics problems that you care about.
