This section contains short previews (with links to the relevant documentation) of a few
additional topics that, although we have not covered them here, do occur quite commonly
in real ROS systems.

## Running ROS over a network

You might remember from Chapter 1 that one of the advantages of ROS is that it facilitates distributed operation of robots, in which many different programs running on multiple computers can interact with each other. However,
throughout this book, the entire ROS system has been contained on a single computer.

To use ROS across a [network](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/NetworkSetup) of [multiple](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/MultipleMachines) computers requires configuration both at the
network level (to ensure that all of the computers can talk to each other) and at the [ROS level](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/EnvironmentVariables) (to ensure that all of nodes can communicate with the master). 
The good news is that, once you have configured things correctly, ROS will take care of the details of network communication. Nodes on different machines can communicate seamlessly,
using precisely the same methods that we've been using on a single machine.

## Writing cleaner programs

The source code for the example programs in this book is primarily optimized for brevity and clarity, rather than for extensibility and maintainability.
In fact, several guidelines are often suggested to write "cleaner" programs that we have not
obeyed in this book. For example, some developers suggest the use of [`ros::Timer`](http://wiki.ros.org/roscpp/Overview/Timers) callbacks instead of `ros::Rate` objects.
Some developers also prefer to reduce the number of global variables and functions by encapsulating all or part of a node's data in a class, using methods of that class 
as [callbacks](http://wiki.ros.org/roscpp_tutorials/Tutorials/UsingClassMethodsAsCallbacks). The payoff from these kinds of techniques tends to increase as the size and 
complexity of the program grows.

## Visualizing data with rviz `rviz`

Working with `turtlesim`, nearly all of the data in our messages dealt with relatively simple information such as two-dimensional positions, orientations, and velocities. 
In contrast, real robots are often substantially more complicated, and none of the techniques we've learned in this book are really suitable for viewing the complex and 
noisy data that they typically produce. To fill this gap, ROS provides a graphical tool called [`rviz`](http://wiki.ros.org/rviz) that can display a wide variety of information — naturally, by subscribing 
to appropriately-typed topics that a user selects — about how the robot itself is operating.

## Creating message and service types

The examples in this book have all relied exclusively on existing data types for [messages and services](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/CreatingMsgAndSrv). However, it is also straightforward to
[create new data types](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/DefiningCustomMessages) that belong to our own packages.

## Managing coordinate frames with `tf`

Because robots operate in the physical world, it
is very natural to use coordinates to describe the positions of various parts of the robot,
along with objects the robot would like to avoid or interact with. Therefore, it becomes crucial 
to keep careful track of the **coordinate frames** in which those coordinates are expressed. Many message types include 
a `frame_id` field that identifies the coordinate frame.
in which that message's data are expressed. 

To make sense of those different coordinate frames, we need to know they are related
to one another. Specifically, we would often like to know the **transformation** that can
convert coordinates from one frame to another. ROS provides a standard package called
`tf` — short for "transformation" — whose job is to enable nodes to utilize information about
those kinds of transforms <sup>[1](#fn1)</sup><sup>[2](#fn2)</sup><sup>[3](#fn3)</sup><sup>[4](#fn4)</sup>. The `tf`package is designed to work robustly, even
when the transformation data is distributed across many nodes, and even when the transformations are changing over time.

## Simulating with Gazebo

One of the biggest advantages of the modular software design
that ROS encourages is that we can easily "swap out" various components of a working system, in order to reduce development time and make testing easier. Chapter 9 described
one example of this capability, in which we can temporarily replace one or more nodes
with a recorded bag of the messages those nodes published. Another more powerful option is to use [Gazebo](http://gazebosim.org/wiki/Tutorials/1.9/Overview_of_new_ROS_integration), which is a high-fidelity robot simulator.
Using Gazebo, we can
define the characteristics of both our robot (or robots) and the world, and interact with
that robot, via ROS, in the same way that we would interact with the real thing.
