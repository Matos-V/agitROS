# Topics and messages

In our `turtlesim` example, it's clear that the teleoperation node and the simulator node
must be talking to each other somehow. Otherwise, how would the turtle, which lives in
the latter node, know when to move in response to your key presses, which are collected
by the former node?

The primary mechanism that ROS nodes use to communicate is to send **messages**.
Messages in ROS are organized into named [**topics**](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/UnderstandingTopics).
The idea is that a node that wants to share information will **publish** messages on 
the appropriate topic or topics; a node that wants to receive information will **subscribe** 
to the topic or topics that it's interested in. The ROS master takes care of ensuring
that publishers and subscribers can find each other; the messages themselves are sent 
directly from publisher to subscriber.

## Viewing the graph

This idea is probably easiest to see graphically, and the easiest way to visualize the publish-
subscribe relationships between ROS nodes is to use this command:

```
rqt_graph
```

In this name, the r is for ROS, and the qt refers to the Qt GUI toolkit used to implement
the program. You should see a GUI, most of which is devoted to showing the nodes in the
current system. In this case, you will see something like the [Figure 2.2](#2.2). In this graph, the ovals
represent nodes, and the directed edges represent publisher-subscriber relationships. The
graph tells us that the node named `/teleop_turtle` publishes messages on a topic called
`/turtle1/cmd_vel`, and that the node named `/turtlesim` subscribes to those messages.
(In this context, the name "`cmd_vel` is short for "command velocity.")

</p>

You might notice that the rosout node that we saw in Section 2.6 is missing from this
view. By default, `rqt_graph` hides nodes that it thinks exist only for debugging. You can
disable this feature by unchecking the "Hide debug" box. [Figure 2.3](#2.3) shows the resulting
graph.

</p>

- Notice that `rqt_graph` itself appears as a node.
- All of these nodes publish messages on a topic called `/rosout`, to which the node
named `/rosout` subscribes. This topic is one mechanism through which nodes can
generate textual log messages. Chapter 4 has more about logging in ROS.

This view of debug nodes is useful for seeing a true picture of the current state of things,
but can also clutter the graph quite a bit with information that is not often very helpful.
The `rqt_graph` tool has several other options for tweaking the way that it shows the
graph. The author's personal preference is to change the dropdown from "Nodes only" to
"Nodes/Topics (all)", and to disable all of the checkboxes except "Hide Debug." This setup,
whose results are shown in [Figure 2.4](#2.4), has the advantage that all of the topics are shown
in rectangles, separate from the nodes. One can see, for example, that the `turtlesim` node,
in addition to subscribing to velocity commands, also publishes both its current pose and
data from a simulated color sensor. When you're exploring a new ROS system, `rqt_graph`,
especially with these options, can be a useful way to discover what topics are available for
your programs to use to communicate with the existing nodes.

Now we can understand at least part of how the `turtlesim` teleoperation system works.
When you press a key, the `/teleop_turtle` node publishes messages with those movement
commands on a topic called `/turtle1/cmd_vel`. Because it subscribes to that topic, the
`turtlesim_node` receives those messages, and simulates the turtle moving with the requested velocity. 
The important points here are:

- The simulator doesn't care (or even know) which program publishes those `cmd_vel`
messages. Any program that publishes on that topic can control the turtle.
- The teleoperation program doesn't care (or even know) which program subscribes
to the `cmd_vel` messages it publishes. Any program that subscribes to that topic is
free to respond to those commands.

By the way, these topic names begin with `/turtle1` because they are concerned with the
default turtle, whose name happens to be "turtle1." We'll see, in Chapter 8, how to add
additional turtles to a `turtlesim` window.

## Messages and message types
So far we've talked about the idea that nodes can send messages to each other, but we've
been quite vague about what information is actually contained in those messages. Let's
take a closer look at the topics and messages themselves.

### Listing topics

To get a list of active topics, use [this command](http://wiki.ros.org/rostopic):
```
rostopic list
```
In our example, this shows a list of five topics:
```
/rosout
/rosout_agg
/turtle1/cmd_vel
/turtle1/color_sensor
/turtle1/pose
```
The topic list should, of course, be the same as the set of topics viewable in `rqt_graph`,
but might be more convenient to see in text form.

### Echoing messages
You can see the actual messages that are being published on a single
topic using the `rostopic` command:
```
rostopic echo topic-name
```
This command will dump any messages published on the given topic to the terminal. The code below shows some example output from
```console
$ rostopic echo /turtle1/cmd_vel
linear:
x:2.0
y:0.0
z:0.0
angular:
x:0.0
y:0.0
z:0.0
−−−
linear:
x:0.0
y:0.0
z:0.0
angular:
x:0.0
y:0.0
z:−2.0
−−−
linear:
x:2.0
y:0.0
z:0.0
angular:
x:0.0
y:0.0
z:0.0
−−−
```
taken at a time when `/teleop_turtle` was receiving keystrokes. Each --- line in the output shows the end 
of one message and the start of another. In this case, there were three messages.

### Measuring publication rates

There are also two commands for measuring the speed at
which messages are published and the bandwidth consumed by those messages:
```
rostopic hz topic-name
rostopic bw topic-name
```
These commands subscribe to the given topic and output statistics in units of messages
per second and bytes per second, respectively.

> ⚠️ Even if you don't care much about the specific rates, these commands can be useful
> for debugging, because they provide an easy way to verify that messages are indeed
> being published regularly on particular topics.

### Inspecting a topic

You can learn more about a topic using the `rostopic` info command:
```
rostopic info topic-name
```
For example, from this command:
```
rostopic info /turtle1/color_sensor
```
you should see output similar to this:
```
Type: turtlesim/Color
Publishers:
  * /turtlesim (http://donatello:46397/)
Subscribers: None
```
The most important part of this output is the very first line, which shows the **message type**
of that topic. In the case of `/turtle1/color_sensor`, the message type is `turtlesim/Color`.
The word "type" in this context is referring to the concept of a **data type**. It's important to
understand message types because they determine the _content_ of the messages. That is,
the message type of a topic tells you what information is included in each message on that
topic, and how that information is organized.

### Inspecting a message type

To see details about a message type, use a command like [this](http://wiki.ros.org/rosmsg):
```
rosmsg show message-type-name
```
Let's try using it on the message type for `/turtle1/color_sensor` that we found above:
```
rosmsg show turtlesim/Color
```
The output is:
```
uint8 r
uint8 g
uint8 b
```
The format is a list of **fields**, one per line. Each field is defined by a built-in data type (like
`int8`, `bool`, or `string`) and a field name. The output above tells us that a `turtlesim/Color`
is a thing that contains three unsigned 8-bit integers called `r`, `g`, and `b`. Every message on
any topic with message type `turtlesim/Color` is defined by values for these three fields.
(As you might guess, these numbers correspond the the red-green-blue color intensities
for the pixel under the center of the simulated turtle.)

Another example, one we'll revisit several times, is `geometry_msgs/Twist`. This is the
message type for the `/turtle1/cmd_vel` topic, and it is slightly more complicated:
```
geometry_msgs/Vector3 linear
  float64 x
  float64 y
  float64 z
geometry_msgs/Vector3 angular
  float64 x
  float64 y
  float64 z
```
In this case, both linear and angular are **composite fields** whose data type is `geometry-_msgs/Vector3`.
The indentation shows that fields named `x`, `y`, and `z` are members within
those two top-level fields. That is, a message with type `geometry_msgs/Twist` contains
exactly six numbers, organized into two vectors called `linear` and `angular`. Each of these
numbers has the built-in type `float64`, which means, naturally, that each is a 64-bit floating
point number.

In general, a composite field is simply a combination of one or more sub-fields, each
of which may be another composite field or a simple field with a built-in data type. The
same idea appears in C++ and other object-oriented languages, in which one object may
have other objects as data members.

Message types can also contain arrays with fixed or variable length (shown with square
brackets `[]`) and constants (generally for interpreting the contents of other, non-constant
fields). These features are not used by turtlesim. For an example message type that uses
these features, have a look at `sensor_msgs/NavSatFix`, which represents a single GPS fix.

### Publishing messages from the command line

Most of the time, the work of publishing
messages is done by specialized programs<sup>2</sup> However, you may find it useful at times to
publish messages by hand. To do this, use [`rostopic`](http://wiki.ros.org/rostopic):
```
rostopic pub -r rate-in-hz topic-name message-type message-content
```
This command repeatedly publishes the given message on the given topic at the given rate.

The final _message content_ parameter should provide values for all of the fields in the
message type, in order. Here's an example:
```
rostopic pub -r 1 /turtle1/cmd_vel geometry_msgs/Twist '[2, 0, 0]' '[0, 0, 0]'
```
The values are assigned to message fields in the same order that they are shown by rosmsg
show. In the case, the first three numbers denote the desired linear velocity and the final
three numbers denote the desired angular velocity. We use single quotes (`'. . . '`) and
square brackets (`[. . . ]`) to group the individual subfields into the two top-level composite
fields. As you might guess, the messages generated by this example command the turtle to
drive straight ahead (along its x-axis), with no rotation.

Likewise, a command like this will command the robot to rotate in place about its zaxis (which is perpendicular to your computer's screen):
```
rostopic pub -r 1 /turtle1/cmd_vel geometry_msgs/Twist '[0, 0, 0]' '[0, 0, 1]'
```
> ⚠️ In fact, the two non-zero fields from the last two examples — specifically, `linear.x`
> and `angular.z` — are the only fields within `geometry_msgs/Twist` that turtlesim
> pays any attention to. Because the other four fields represent motions that the two
> dimensional simulator does not allow, `turtlesim` ignores them.

> ⏩ The syntax shown above has the distinct disadvantage that you must remember all
> of the fields of the message type and the order in which they appear. An alternative
> is to give single parameter specifying all of the fields as a single YAML (a recursive
> acronym for ["YAML Ain't Markup Language"](http://www.yaml.org/)) dictionary. This command (which
> does, in fact, contain newline characters) is equivalent to the one above, but it explicitly shows the mapping from field names to values:
> ```
> rostopic pub /turtle1/cmd_vel geometry_msgs/Twist "linear:
> x: 2.0
> y: 0.0
> z: 0.0
> angular:
> x: 0.0
> y: 0.0
> z: 0.0"
> ```
> There are enough tricky interactions between `bash` and YAML that the online documentation has an entire page devoted just to the use of
> [YAML](http://wiki.ros.org/YAML%20Overview) on the [command line](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/YAMLCommandLine). 
> The simplest way to get the syntax correct is to use tab completion.
> 
> Pressing <kbd>Tab</kbd> after entering the message type will insert a fully formed YAML dictionary, with all of the fields in the given message type. The tab-generated message
> will use default values (zero, false, empty string, etc), but you can edit it to contain
> the real message content that you want.

There are a few additional options to `rostopic pub ` that might be of use.

- The form shown here uses `-r` to select the "rate mode" of `rostopic pub`, which publishes messages at regular intervals. This command also supports a one-time mode (`-1` "dash one") and a special "latched" mode (`-l` "dash ell") that publishes only once but ensures that new subscribers to that topic will receive the message. Latched mode is actually the default.
- It is also possible to read messages from a file (using `-f`) or from standard input (by omitting both `-f` and the message content from the command). In both cases, the input should be formatted like the output of `rostopic echo`.

> of `rostopic echo` and `rostopic pub` as a way of "recording" and "playing back" messages, for automating testing of your programs. If so, you'll be interested in the
> `rosbag tool` (Chapter 9), which is a more complete implementation of this kind of
> idea.

### Understanding message type names

Like everything else in ROS, every message type
belongs to a specific package. Message type names always contain a slash, and the part
before the slash is the name of the containing package:
```
package-name/type-name
```
For example, the `turtlesim/Color` message type breaks down this way:

| package name  | type name    | message data type  |
| ------------- | ------------ | ------------------ |
| `turtlesim` | `Color`  | `turtlesim/Color` |

This division of message type names serves a few purposes:
- Most directly, including packages in the message type names helps to prevent **name collisions**. For example, `geometry_msgs/Pose` and `turtlesim/Pose` are distinct message types that contain different (but conceptually similar) data.
- As we'll see in Chapter 3, when writing ROS programs, we'll need to declare dependencies on other packages that contain message types that we use. Including the package name as part of the message type name makes these dependencies easier to see
- Finally, knowing the package that contains a given message type can be useful for figuring out that type's purpose. For example, the type name `ModelState` is quite mysterious in isolation, but the full name `gazebo/ModelState` clarifies that this message type is part of the Gazebo simulator, and likely contains information about one of the models within that simulation.
